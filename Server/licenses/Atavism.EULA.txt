8.  Indemnity. You agree that Neojac and its licensors,
    distributors, contractors and agents shall have no liability
    whatsoever for any use You make of the Software. You shall indemnify
    and hold harmless Neojac and its licensors, suppliers,

    permitted by applicable law, You hereby release, and waive all claims
    against, Neojac and its licensors, suppliers, employees and agents
    from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and

    foreign agency or authority, and you agree not to export, or allow the
    export or re-export of the Software in violation of any such
    restrictions, laws or regulations. By using the Software, You agree to
    the foregoing and represent and warrant that You are not located in,
    under the control of, or a national or resident of any restricted

11. Miscellaneous.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or
    employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not
    have any authority of any kind to bind Neojac in any respect
    whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any
    right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further
    rights hereunder.  If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
    unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or
    eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement
    shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This
    Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you
    except with Neojac’s prior written consent. Neojac may
    transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and
    obligations without consent.  This Agreement shall be governed by and
    construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Alberta, as
    if made within Alberta between two residents thereof, and the
    parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
    Alberta and Canada. Notwithstanding the foregoing
    sentence, (but without limiting Neojac’s right to seek injunctive
    or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction), any
    disputes arising with respect to this Agreement shall be referred to
    an arbitrator affiliated with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
    Services, Inc. ("JAMS").  The arbitrator shall be selected by joint
    agreement of the parties.  In the event the parties cannot agree on an
    arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing
    the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration,
    the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS,
    which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to
    resolve the dispute.  The written decision of the arbitrator shall be
    final and binding on the parties.  The arbitration proceeding shall be
    carried on and heard in Calgary, Alberta, Canada using the English
    language and pursuant to the rules of (and administered by) JAMS.  In
    any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the
    prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys'
    fees.  Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and
    exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and
    supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements,
    communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter
    of this Agreement and, except as otherwise provided herein, that all
    modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties.
